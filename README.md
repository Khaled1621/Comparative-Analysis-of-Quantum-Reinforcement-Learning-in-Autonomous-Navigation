# Comparative Analysis of Quantum Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Navigation

This repository contains the research paper **"Comparative Analysis of Quantum Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Navigation"**, completed as part of the Introduction to Quantum Computing course at the American University of Beirut. The paper presents a comparative study of Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) techniques in autonomous navigation, focusing on their advantages, limitations, and potential applications.

## 📄 Abstract

Autonomous navigation systems face significant challenges in dynamic and uncertain environments. While classical Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have shown promise, they struggle with scalability, efficiency, and uncertainty. Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) combines the principles of quantum computing and RL to address these challenges, leveraging techniques like superposition and entanglement. This paper provides a comparative analysis of QRL applied to navigation tasks using benchmarks such as the Frozen Lake environment and the [CARLA simulator](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla.git).
